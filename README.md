# P2P-Chat-

 A chat client and server that can be used for communication between 2 users in
different hosts.  A sentence, typed by the user, will be transmitted to the server in the
remote machine (only after ENTER is pressed) and the server will display the same to the
screen. The server must use a welcome socket that has a dedicated port number. You can
use java swing so as to create a separate display area and text area in the screen. In the
text area, the client types his message and the same gets re ected in the diplay area (after
ENTER is pressed), preceded by his username. The messages sent by the other user is also
displayed in the display area.
